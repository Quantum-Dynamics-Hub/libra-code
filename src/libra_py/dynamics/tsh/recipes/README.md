# Generating TSH Recipes


This folder contains the recipes that are semi-autogenerated. 
First, you need to have an initial file like `dish_edc_fssh2_g_jt.py`.
In this file, everything must be defined. Now, for example, you want to generate 
the FSSH2 with SDM and Schwartz 2 decoherence time method. You need to change two things: `dyn_general.update({ "decoherence_algo":7})` to `dyn_general.update({ "decoherence_algo":0})`
and `"decoherence_times_type":1` to `"decoherence_times_type":3`.
One apply the changes

```bash
cp dish_edc_fssh2_g_jt.py sdm_schw2_fssh2_g_jt.py
sed -i 's/"decoherence_algo":7/"decoherence_algo":0/g' sdm_schw2_fssh2_g_jt.py
```
Now, if you have already obtained all DISH method files for different TSH methods. You can do this to all of them as:
```bash
for file in $(ls dish*); do 
  echo "${file//dish_/sdm_}"
  cp $file "${file//dish_/sdm_}"
  sed -i 's/"decoherence_algo":7/"decoherence_algo":0/g' "${file//dish_/sdm_}"
done
```
After you obtained all files for DISH and SDM, you can generate them for when SSY correction is applied by:
```bash
for file in $(ls dish*); do
  echo "${file//.py/_ssy.py}"
  cp $file "${file//.py/_ssy.py}"
  sed -i 's/"do_ssy":0/"do_ssy":1' "${file//.py/_ssy.py}"
done
```
