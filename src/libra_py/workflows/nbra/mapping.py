def sd2indx(inp,nbasis, do_sort=True):
    """

    This function maps a list of integers defining the 
    occupied spin-orbitals in a SD onto the global indices of the orbitals
    that are being occupied.     

    Args:
        inp ( list of ints ): indices of the occupied spin-orbitals. 
            Indexing starts with 1, not 0!

            Positive number ```n``` correspond to an alpha electron occupying the 
            orbital (whether it is an alpha-spatial or beta-spatial component) ```n```

            Negative number ```-n``` correspond to a beta electron occupying the 
            orbital (whether it is an alpha-spatial or beta-spatial component) ```n```

        nbasis ( int ): the total number of orbitals orbitals (both alpha- and beta-
            spatial components ) in the selected active space [currently not really used!]

        do_sort ( Boolean ): the flag to tell whether the indices should be sorted in 
            a particular order:
                - True - for new scheme (needed for the SAC) [default]
                - use with False for Pyxaid mapping!


    Returns: 
        list of ints: the indices of the orbitals occupied in this SD (different convention)

    Example: 

        Assume out active space consists of 4 orbitals:  |1^a>, |1^b>, |2^a>, |2^b>.
        Here, the superscript indicates the spin-component of the given orbital.

        In the step2 they are grouped as |1^a>, |2^a>, |1^b>, |2^b>

        And indexed (overall) as:           1     2      3      4  (as used in the input)
                                            0     1      2      3  (as used in the output)
        Note: this indexing convention assumes starting from 1, not from 0!
       
        So the ```nbasis``` should be = 4

        Input SD = [1, -3] means that the orbital |1^a> is occupied by an alpha electron |a>
        and the orbital |1^b> is occupied by a beta electron |b>, so the SD is:

        SD = 1/sqrt(2) * | |1^a>|a>   |1^b>|b> |
        
        This function will return the global indices of the occupied orbitals in the 
        set of active orbitals. That is the conversion will be:
        [1, -3] -> [0, 2]
        Note that the output indices start from 0
