 This library privides a general approach to hold parameters of 
 various kind - the base class

 The derived classes will hold purpose-specific interpretations

 If you need to use some new semantics for parameters - just add a new derived
 class here and then use it in your applications.

 Initially, one might think of keeping the classes in corresponding folders
 e.g. implementing EHT parameters in the EHT Hamiltonian section, 
 but this approach will scatter the classes, so it may be not so convenient to use.

 In contrast, we will place all the input/parameter structures here, to form a real 
 library/collection, even though the classes may be not related to each other directly
 or even repeat/overlap. One will, however, be able to pick what is needed from the present 
 collection.

 Also note that these classes are not always the internal representation used for computations.
 Those efficiency-oriented classes storing internal parameters will be provided in the libraries
 with corresponding functionality.
