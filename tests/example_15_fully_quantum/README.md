## Example 1

   Illustrates the basic use of Wfcgrid class: how to initialize the 1D grid, set up the 
   initial wavepacket, compute its properties and visualize it and other properties


## Example 2

   Illustrates how one can run fully quantum simulations for 1D models (and define them 
   in a Python script) and to print out useful information
   

## Example 3

   Illustrates how to initialize the wavefunctions to be the superpositions of HO eigenstates


## Example 4

   The analytical solution for dynamics involving superposition of HO eigenstates
