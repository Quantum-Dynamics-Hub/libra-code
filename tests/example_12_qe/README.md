  The following directories must be present for you to be able to run the 
  test calculation added in this example

  nosoc_nospinpol_1x1x1
  nosoc_nospinpol_2x1x1
  nosoc_nospinpol_2x2x2
  nosoc_spinpol_1x1x1
  nosoc_spinpol_2x1x1
  nosoc_spinpol_2x2x2
  soc_1x1x1
  soc_2x1x1
  soc_2x2x2


  The results of the calculations would be too big to track by the git, so please compute them yourself.
  The examples of input files for each type of calculations are given in the directories
  

  The meaning of the content in each directory is pretty much self-explanatory, but just to be sure:

  nosoc vs. soc - refers to whether spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is included or not
                  Note, the SOC calculations require fully-relativistic pseudopotential

  nospinpol vs. spinpol  - refers to whether the non-relativistic calculations are spin-polarized or not

  k1 x k2 x k3 - refers the the k-points grid used in the calculations
