# Libra

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Quantum-Dynamics-Hub/libra-code.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Quantum-Dynamics-Hub/libra-code)


This is the main page of the computational chemistry methodology discovery library, Libra
The program website is [here](https://quantum-dynamics-hub.github.io/libra/index.html)

## Info

* [How to install](https://quantum-dynamics-hub.github.io/libra/installation.html)
* [Training & Usage](https://github.com/compchem-cybertraining/Tutorials_Libra)
* [Autogenerated Documentation](https://quantum-dynamics-hub.github.io/libra-code/)


Due to the increased volume of technical questions about installing and using the 
Libra, Libra-X, Pyxaid and Pyxaid2 codes, I have decided to create a convenient 
[public forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quantum-dynamics-hub)
for all users with the intent:

 - to share my replies with not only a single user that have a trouble, but also other
   potential users who may found that information useful;

 - so that the users/developers who have had some experience with the code would be able to share their
   knowledge and skills with others;
